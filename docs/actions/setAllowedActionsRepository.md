# Set allowed actions and reusable workflows for a repository

Sets the actions and reusable workflows that are allowed in a repository. To use this endpoint, the repository permission policy for `allowed_actions` must be configured to `selected`. For more information, see "[Set GitHub Actions permissions for a repository](#set-github-actions-permissions-for-a-repository)."

If the repository belongs to an organization or enterprise that has `selected` actions and reusable workflows set at the organization or enterprise levels, then you cannot override any of the allowed actions and reusable workflows settings.

To use the `patterns_allowed` setting for private repositories, the repository must belong to an enterprise. If the repository does not belong to an enterprise, then the `patterns_allowed` setting only applies to public repositories.

You must authenticate using an access token with the `repo` scope to use this endpoint. GitHub Apps must have the `administration` repository permission to use this API.

```js
octokit.rest.actions.setAllowedActionsRepository({
  owner,
  repo,
});
```
